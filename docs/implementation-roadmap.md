# Implementation Roadmap - Q2-Q3 2025

This document outlines the planned implementation sequence for the MTG Collection Analyzer project.

## Completed Features

- [x] Basic collection management (CRUD operations)
- [x] CSV import for card collections
- [x] Scryfall API integration for card data enrichment
- [x] Text analysis system for card text extraction
- [x] Synergy detection between cards
- [x] Database schema enhancement (split Card into CardInfo and CardPrinting)

## Current Sprint: Enhanced Synergy Detection (June 2025)

### Week 1-2: Advanced Synergy Algorithms

- [ ] Implement weighted scoring for different types of card interactions
- [ ] Develop context-aware synergy detection (accounting for card types, colors, etc.)
- [ ] Create metrics to measure synergy strength between cards
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities to search for specific types of synergies

### Week 3-4: Visualization Enhancements

- [ ] Create interactive web-based graph visualization with D3.js
- [ ] Implement grouping of cards by synergy clusters
- [ ] Add zoom/filter capabilities to the graph visualization
- [ ] Develop card relationship explorer in the web UI

## Next Sprint: Collection Analysis (July 2025)

### Week 1-2: Collection Statistics

- [ ] Implement collection value estimation
- [ ] Add statistical analysis of collection (color distribution, rarity, etc.)
- [ ] Create dashboard with key collection metrics
- [ ] Add export functionality for collection reports

### Week 3-4: Deck Building Assistance

- [ ] Develop deck suggestion engine based on synergies
- [ ] Implement "cards you might need" recommendations
- [ ] Create format legality checker
- [ ] Add support for importing/exporting deck lists

## Future Sprints (August-September 2025)

### Performance & Scalability

- [ ] Optimize database queries for large collections
- [ ] Implement background processing for time-consuming operations
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Create bulk operations for collection management

### User Experience

- [ ] Add user authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Implement customizable card tagging system
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive UI
- [ ] Add dark mode support

### Integration

- [ ] Implement price tracking integration
- [ ] Add support for multiple data sources beyond Scryfall
- [ ] Create export functionality to popular deck building sites
- [ ] Develop API for third-party integrations

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Refactor database access layer for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Optimize image handling and storage
